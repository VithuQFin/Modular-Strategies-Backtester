# Simple Modular Strategy Backtester

This project is a modular backtesting engine for evaluating trading strategies such as **Moving Average Crossover** and **Mean Reversion**. It allows users to simulate trades, measure performance, and generate detailed analytics using historical data.

## Strategy Overview

Mean Reversion

    Based on z-score of price relative to a moving average

    Buy when price is significantly below average (undervalued)

    Sell when price is significantly above average (overvalued)

Moving Average Crossover

    Long when short MA > long MA

    Exit when short MA < long MA

Sample Output

    Orders executed: ðŸ“‹ BUY/SELL logs

    Portfolio value curve: ðŸ’° over time

    Strategy vs Market return: ðŸ“ˆ

    Risk metrics: âœ… Sharpe, volatility, drawdown
